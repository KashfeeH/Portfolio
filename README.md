# Module 2 CSS: Responsive Portfolio Challenge

## Description

This is week two and the challenge this time was to harness all that we have learnt the past week about grid, flexboxes, absolute/relative positions, variables and media queries
and create a responsive Portfolio page. I have used my beginners knowledge on HTML/CSS including a lot of help from Google and created a rather simple responsive portfolio
page. I have yet to embark upon any projects or application and therefore, they are empty for now. This challenge was indeed a big step up from last weeks simple
code refactoring. However, I have learnt quite a bit more about the concepts mentioned and have found it very interesting. At times I was frustrated when a certain 
part of the code was not working but I realized taking a break from the screen and thinking about the problem from a different angle always helped.

### Acceptance Criteria

The following were the acceptance criteria that my portfolio was supposed to meet :

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

Every effort was made to meet each of these criteria. Due to lack of expereince and kwowledge I could not write the prettiest of css was it is a work in progress
and I will get there. My portfolio resembles the mockup functionalty that was provied for the challenge.
